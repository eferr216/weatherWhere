# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.

### Week 4 work

10/12/2016 - 14 hours

Completed all Checkpoint 1 items for the project. Built the basic functionality for the project including setting up test DB and hibernate.

### Week 5 work

- 16 hours

Added a one-to-many relationship in my project. Added testing for the Daos' methods and created a generic dao as well. Added Javadoc comments to all methods. Struggled on getting Hibernate annotations to work correctly. After hours of difficulties I finally figured it out with the help of the weekly videos.

### Week 6 work

-20 hours

Used Elastic Beanstalk and RDS to host my project on AWS. Struggled a lot with getting my JDBC connection to work when hosting the application through AWS services. Learned about RDS and using it to communicate with databases.
